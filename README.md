## Inspiration
For decades, educational interventions have operated reactively, waiting until students encounter academic hardships before offering support. This approach often proves ineffective, as by the time assistance arrives, students may already have experienced significant setbacks. This problem inspired me to create the Student Grade Predictor which will help identify students at risk of academic hardship and help faculty intervene before students experience a setback.  

## What it does
The Student Grade Predictor can take in information of students from an entire school and provide faculty with a convenient interface with which they can monitor students' predicted academic outcomes. This will help faculty spot students that may have a downward academic trend and help these students through individualized interventions.
